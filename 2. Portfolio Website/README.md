# Portfolio Website

#### This project consists of my Portfolio Website. 

It is based on the design of a mockup PDF-file and I replicated the design in HTML and CSS. 
This page is a responsive website that will display images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects I will complete through the course of my **Udacity Nanodegree program**.
